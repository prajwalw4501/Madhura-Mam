Hashing observations
1. Emp class - equals n hashCode --wasn't overridden
Obs : Dups were getting added (since UID based equals method wasn;t supplied)

2. Emp class - equals : overridden based upon id BUT hashCode --wasn't overridden
Obs : Dups were getting added (since mandatory part of the contract wasn't satsfied)

3. Emp class - equals : overridden based upon id  , hashCode - overridden to ret constant value eg : 100
Obs : Dups were NOT getting added (since mandatory part of the contract was satsfied) BUT offers : O(n) => no of times equals method getting called was increasing linearly !

4. Emp class - equals : overridden based upon id  , hashCode - overridden to ret id 

Obs : Dups were NOT getting added (since mandatory part of the contract was satsfied) BUT offers : O(1) => no of times equals method getting called was NOT increasing linearly ! --reason being optional part of the contract was also followed.

-------------------------------
If UID i.e  emp id : String
What will be the changes required to follow the contract ?
How will you override equals n hashCode ?
